contract_priv_key: int = F(contract_code)
contract_pub_key = ecsda.key...(contract_priv_key)


receiver_address should be contract_pub_key
contract_priv_key_enc is stored as contract_priv_key



====
We want to restrict txns having sender_address as any contract_pub_key format


================
1. contract_priv_key -> private key
2. contract receiver public_key -> public_key (of some format)


    1. whenever we receive a tx from user: // check in newtransaction
        check if sender_address is a contract address (format)
            if yes, reject it
    2. if is_contract: // check in newtransaction
        check if any other contract exists on same public_key. If yes, reject this contract
